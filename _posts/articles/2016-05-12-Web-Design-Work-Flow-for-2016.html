<p>Designing websites is so much more than throwing together some layout and fonts. The process dives much deeper than that. What web design has become is an iterative process of discovery and problem solving.</p>
<p>Your brand has a goal in mind and I want to help that goal be realized through design.</p>
<h2 id="questions-are-the-building-blocks-and-the-center-of-focus-on-doing-a-site-design">Questions are the building blocks and the center of focus on doing a site design</h2>
<p>We need to understand the scope of the project. Utilizing a process of asking solid, fact finding questions will help us get to the core of what needs to be done.</p>
<p>You are the expert of what you do and who you do it for. My job is to get to know that part of your brand and apply that to the goals we have laid out.</p>
<div class="callout"><h2><em>What role does a website have in your brand goals</em></h2></div>

<h2 id="content-is-king">Content is King</h2>
<p>For any of my work to be effective, I need to know what content will be designed. It&#39;s like building a very nice shelf, it looks great, but if we put stuff on it, is it going to fit? <em>Will there be enough space? Will there be too much space? Maybe what we needed was a storage compartment?</em></p>
<p>Visitors to your site should feel like they know where things are, and can complete the tasks they are there to accomplish, without having to think about it. After we itemize what content is there, we can consider going into the <em>R &amp; D</em>.</p>
<h2 id="we-ll-establish-a-proposal-and-agreement-for-the-project">We&#39;ll establish a proposal and agreement for the project</h2>
<p>Once we have established goals and have discovered what the value of reaching those goals would bring to your brand and organization, I put together a proposal that restates the goals and desired solution that outlines how I will help you achieve them through design.</p>
<p> I will also put together an agreement that will have a project specific process, initial timeline guides, and terms for the business relationship. We will have set aside time to go over this, paragraph by paragraph so that we can be sure we are on the same page before moving forward. </p>
<h2 id="r-d-initialization-this-is-where-the-magic-happens">R &amp; D: Initialization â€” This is where the magic happens</h2>
<p>This stage of the process goes over the hardest part of web design: solving the problems. I do my best work here when I have a pen and sketchbook close by.
I grab a good cup of coffee, some good tunes, and I start going over the initial questionnaire. <em>What styles would best describe this brand&#39;s message?</em></p>
<p>Sometimes doing some research on what is current in your industry can help, sometimes going out into the world and finding a nice spot to iterate ideas will work too. But the main point is getting some initial ideas of where the design should be going. This leads into designing a great style-guide for your content.</p>
