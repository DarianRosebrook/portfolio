    <h2>Who is Darian Rosebrook?</h2>
    <p class="desktop">Since the early stages of 2015, I have worked for over 2000 hours building a legacy for my family by working in design. I have been guiding brands with Brand Identity design and Web Design for over a year. As a dedicated single father, I love to share as much time and as many experiences as I humanly can with my son. This same dedication has been put to understanding and pursuing creative solutions to difficult problems. I am always looking for ways to build or improve recognizable brands and user centered websites.  </p>

        <blockquote class="mobile">&ldquo;Since the early stages of 2015, Darian Rosebrook has worked for over 2000 hours building a legacy for his family with design. His creative eye has been guiding brands with Brand Identity design and Web Design for over a year.

Darian is always looking for ways to improve and build recognizable brands and user centered websites.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>Though I have done simple versions of design of work before, I started taking design seriously in August 2015. There were plenty occupations that I had experience doing, and a large portion did not directly relate to doing websites or branding for businesses. My only solution to my lack of history was to get education and practice.</p>
        <p>I started by asking around where people had been learning how to do what they do. Though I kept hearing that I just "need to start", my initial plan was to get some of the ball rolling as soon as possible. To do this, I enrolled into a 3 month long certification course.</p>
        <p>After starting this hustle, I eventually acquired a handful of mentors, people who could keep me on task and motivated. For me to be able to get done what I needed to do during the day, I needed more time. After a while, I had to forgo some things to be able to keep my learning and projects going, sacrificing one of the more important human needs.

      <h2><a href="http://www.growyourcode.com/episodes/28402-a-chat-with-darian-rosebrook" target="_blank">Opportunities to share what I've learned</a></h2>
      <p>Back towards the beginning of my carreer as a web designer, I had the opportunity to be interviewed on air for the Grow Your Code podcast. The podcast logo was an early project of mine, and I have since been iterating and continually practicing. But for those who might have missed it when I started, <a href="http://www.growyourcode.com/episodes/28402-a-chat-with-darian-rosebrook" target="_blank">here is the podcast that I was interviewed on</a></p>
      <p>Here are a few questions we covered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What do you do?</li>
        <li>How did you get into UI/UX design?</li>
        <li>What do you love/like about your field? Anything you dislike or find hard to do?</li>
        <li>If you could be better at one aspect of your field what would it be?</li>
        <li>What does your future look like and how do you plan to get there?</li>

  <h2>What I've been up to</h2>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Put My Head Down, Got to Work</h4>
    <p>After getting my web certification from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darianrosebrook#background-education" target="_blank">the technical class that I took</a>, I had focused on doing client work and practice briefs. After getting my hands on a couple of college syllabi for design programs, I started consuming content, courses, teaching, and articles around my industry to <a href="/archive/case-studies" target="_blank">put those design principles to practice</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>I Started Writing</h4>
    <p>Writing has always been a challenge for me. I'm working on pushing past that by <a href="/archive/articles" target="_blank">creating articles</a> that are being put out across the internet. Every morning I try to write for at least 20 minutes regarding anything that I need to address, as well as starting my email list for <a href="#mailchimp">a newsletter on growth-hacking, entrepreneurship, and branding.</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Started Working Part-Time</h4>
    <p>You will find that when you are constantly putting out content, asking for feedback, and always trying to grow, that people start to notice. A few months after I had <a href="/archive/grow-your-code-update/" target="_blank">started my first logo design project</a>, the CEO of the new web design agency KeySpark asked if I could come on to the team part time as <a href="https://keyspark.io/#darian" target="_blank">their Design Lead</a> for their projects. I've gotten to work on some crazy projects that I could share <a class="contactBtn" data-href="#contact" href="#contact">upon request</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Revamped My Portfolio</h4>
    <p>One important part of being a designer is having a portfolio that matches the level of professionalism that you are trying to get. <a href="/archive/portfolio-v5">My first portfolio</a> was selfishly designed to appease me, without regard to what audience I would be working in and what their needs would be. Though I have gotten inbound leads, this version of the portfolio is only just one of many to come.</p>

Compass of Design is that for me, a place of good people, many of them I would consider friends by now, who exchanges, talks and motivates another. Or just to share a silly video now and then. I had the opportunity to write my first article on Medium under the Compass of Design brand. Something I never even dreamt about something like that. Thank you Darian & the whole group. &rdquo;
