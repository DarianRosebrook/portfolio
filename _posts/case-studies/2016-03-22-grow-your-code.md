### Background

#### Giving a face to a podcast.

Podcasting has hit a new resurgence. Since the early 2000s, people across the globe have been giving their voice to people in the form of podcasts. During a period of time people started to lose interest until recently when the production barrier was lowered and it was capable for more people to start a podcast.

Enter Tyrel Chambers, a developer from Peterborough a city in Ontario, Canada. He's been around the same groups as I have and I've gotten to see him grow as a leader and developer. He came to the group asking if anyone knew someone who did logos.

<small>Tools used: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Sketching</small>

## Goals
* New logo or Brandmark
* Something in the industry of coding and teaching
* Needed the logo within the time restraint
* Something simple and usable across multiple platforms

### Research

#### What personifies growing one's code?

We needed something that fit the idea of growth. When someone is building their knowledge of something, it takes a long time, but that knowledge lasts. So when coming to an idea for the Grow Your Code, I wanted something that fit what the area he's from and the industry his work is in. Both natural yet electronic.

I started thinking of evergreen trees and how they grow over time. Coming up with the first part of the logo is a general feel for the styling.

### Development

I had an initial idea of where to start, so I started to conceptualize what a logo of the sorts, representing code and growth would look like.

What was difficult was coming up with a decent idea within the few days he gave me before his next podcast episode. Once I got a few ideas on paper, I starred what was working. I took from the best elements of each and started to go into illustrator to get the working ideas into a digital form.

### Final Concept

At the end of the sketching both digitally and analog, I came to the conclusion we would need enough sizes for different media, as well as dark and light monochromes should he decide to display on his personal site as well. The finals consist of an emblem with the full name, a circle emblem with the initials, and the hexagonal emblem with the initials. The full logo has the code brackets "\< \>" in there to symbolize the code with the trees as growing. The variant omits the brackets to increase legibility from smaller sizes.

I also threw in a stylized banner radio banner style for flavour.
