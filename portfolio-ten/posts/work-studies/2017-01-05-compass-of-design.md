# Overview

My role with Compass of Design was maintaining the total user experience of our community web application and unifying the brand experience from a visual perspective. The project also requires my skills in responsive web design to map our existing marketing interface into a mobile view as well as starting the structure for making this a better progressive web app. The detailed mockups, standard guides, and user experience maps, and illustrations help maintain a consistent feel coming from the web version to mobile.

## The Membership site

Everything you'll see here is just a small snippet of the work that was done for the project. As the senior user experience designer, working with other admins of the community allowed me to delegate some other aspects of the project while I built out the base of the work.

The entire design system I made for Compass spans many files and is consumed by the front end marketing site and the back end membership application. The project and mockups were made over a mixture of Adobe XD, Figma, and Invision Studio, the guidance for the code and design together are logged in Notion (the same as the site here).
