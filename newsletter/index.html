    <h2>I want to invite you to get early access to the articles.</h2>
    <p> Being a person to miss out on the fun isn't the best feeling. Throughout the next year, I'll be increasing the amount of value available for the articles I write.</p>
    <p>Every week I am researching a new topic or technique and want to add you in on the fun. I send out a newsletter to the people interested in growing their professionalism with design through weekly articles between KeySpark and here. I want you to be able to have access to the same resources that I'm learning from</p>

    <h4>Early Access subscribers get:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thursday</strong>: A newsletter outlining my thoughts on the work I'm doing and links to the resources I used that week.</li>
      <li><strong>Thursday</strong>: Access to the next week's article to read, comment, discuss and help edit.</li>
      <li>Credit that links back to you for edits and discussions that I can accept and add to the value to the article.</li>
      <li>Personal hi-five. (digital of course, unless we run into each other. That would be cool.)</li>
    </ul>
