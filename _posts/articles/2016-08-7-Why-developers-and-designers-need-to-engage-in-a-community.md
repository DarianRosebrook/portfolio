## Where do you usually turn when you need to ask a question?
Imagine yourself new to your career as a designer. That could mean that you are just rolling out of college or high school wondering what's next, or you could be like me who was tired of doing the current work and was looking for a change. What no one tells you is that it's hard to sift through the noise of information out in the world. There are countless resources all over the internet about whatever it is you need to know. And when it comes to design questions that I needed answers for, I had two people in my life who kind of know about what I'm trying to learn. Most of the time though, I've had to turn to the almighty Google and throw it questions like feeding fish to an army of angry penguins.

Many times while searching for information about building websites, I have had to turn to YouTube to figure out what I need to do next. The answers that I got was unhelpful until I stumbled upon the video ["How to Code a Responsive HTML Email."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnWIperMy08) Which, I admit, is an odd one to jump into. This cool cat's name is Travis and he's the host of the [DevTips Show](http://devtipsshow.com/). I usually look at YouTube videos like these when I want to learn something new even though it can be as productive as it is unproductive.

## So why did this change everything for me?
I had found that just watching videos wasn't cutting it. I needed help with things that I was learning, had so many questions. I looked to what seemed like random corners of the internet for answering questions and even resorted to asking people with personal websites using their contact forms. (Yes, I was that committed.) When I finally found the answer to something I was looking for, I just happened to watch the end of another DevTips video, the host, Travis, talked again about the DevTips Community.

## So what does a community do?

A community is a group of people who collectively come together around a certain purpose or walk of life. They form when at least two people are drawn to some idea or interest. It is the first time you realize that you aren't the only one who needs what it is you are looking for. For the commune of web designers and developers, the ability to be in a central location and ask for help is invaluable. Each different community has a certain niche that draws people from any corner of the globe.

When this forms how you think of communities this helps you see that they are all around you. Maybe it's the yoga group that meets every week, maybe it's the church down the road, or your high school buddies hanging out at the parking lot of a Safeway (you do you, Arlington). I know that there are meetups for all types of careers, code languages, ideas, religions in every town. People convene in locations all around you and you might not even see it.

The benefit of online communities are that you have access to some of the minds of others at any given point from any type of life. They should be treated like an investment where you get more from it the more you put in. You have the ability to share what you know because not a single person has had the exact path that you have had in your life. That may benefit someone who hasn't been able to look at something the same way as you. By sharing what you know, you're able to help yourself solidify what you know, or even realize what you still have to learn.

## What is DevTips and the DevTips Community?
Quoting Travis himself, DevTips is "a weekly YouTube show that focuses on web development and design." It's focused on exploring the front end development side of making website designs. It's pure gold to someone like me who's wondered how certain things are done with the crazy and unpredictable CSS and JavaScript (ECMAScript). This show is hosted by Travis Nielsen, now (at the time of this writing) an employee at Google who has been doing awesome videos for the past few years. Travis has built a large following of over 125,000 subscribers (again, at the time of this writing) who all want to learn more about the design to development process. I can say from personal experience, I owe a lot of my current skills to what I have learned from his videos.

He has grown his channel into something much more than himself. At a certain point, you have people that are hungry for more and willing to support the content you make, and Travis has helped facilitate that. In return, he has created an online community group for the patrons of the show, [which you can check out here](http://www.patreon.com/devtips).
