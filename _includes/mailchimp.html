      <h4><label for="mce-EMAIL">Get early access to the articles and other branding tips from my newsletter:</label></h4>
      <p>Every Thursday I send out a newsletter with my thoughts and links to the research for upcoming design articles. Newsletter subscribers get early access to the each article. This access grants them the ability to contribute their ideas, discuss the topic, and help edit the newest article before it is published. And as I continue to grow this list, I'll continue to grow the resources available for those who sign up.</p>
