      <p class="desktop">I've been consistently building out two side projects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https:/compassofdesign.com">Compass of Design</a></strong> &mdash; a designer community</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https:/somagnetic.com">So Magnetic</a></strong> &mdash; a branding design agency</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On top of that, I do a lot of teaching and fun things across the internet and in the offline world. Here you'll see updates on all of that as they happen.</p>

      <h4>Building the Compass of Design Community app</h4>
      <p >This project has been a huge step in what I'm able to achieve as the sole person on a project. This product utilizes my knowledge in UX Design, UI Design, and Back End Development by wrapping all of those together into one product. The Compass of Design Membership Site. This platform is going to be a powerhouse in helping designers get actionable feedback on questions they have and designs they've done. So far, there hasn't been a site that effectively does this without it becoming a popularity contest. Our goal here is to change the way we do design feedback!</p>
