title: "Getting design feedback that matters"
description: One thing I am passionate about is quality design feedback. I’ll mention in a future post that it’s sometimes best to get other eyes on your projects, but having objective, quality design feedback is something that a designer needs to be able to move forward with their design skills.

hey designers welcome to the compass of
 design my name is Darian Rosebrook and
 I want to talk to you today about giving
 design feedback so I don't know if
 you've ever tried going to any of those
 design websites like I don't know a
 designer news dribble behance Facebook
 group slack groups Twitter definitely
 don't go to Twitter but a lot of times
 we have work that we're starting to get
 a little bit stuck on and we need a
 little bit of help moving forward so
 who's the best people to weigh in on
 this well essentially there's a lot of
 designers who think that their client is
 the perfect person to go to now one of
 the things that I believe in as a
 designer is that you don't ask someone
 who's not a designer to make a design
 decision they just don't have the
 quality training they don't have the the
 know-how the knowledge the expertise
 that you yourself are supposed to have
 if the client came to you for you to
 design something they're probably the
 last person to go to to make a design
 decision because they they came to you
 to do the design decisions so if you're
 going to get design feedback what do you
 do
 so I were on a design community called
 the compass of design community and in
 that group we have a huge focus on
 giving actionable feedback so there's a
 few things that you need in order to do
 that one is context you need to know
 exactly what it is
 that person is there to design so that's
 with having a little bit of knowledge
 about the background of the project kind
 of who the client is kind of who the
 audience is for and then what kind of
 researcher step you taken beforehand to
 get to that point and then after having
 a little bit of a backer
 next you should definitely outline what
 kind of feedback you're looking for so
 if you don't define what kind of
 feedback you're looking for you're gonna
 get feedback on things that you either
 won already done with or to really
 that's not what she came to them do ask
 for feedback probably making you more
 stuck and then realizing that maybe you
 should design a different solution so if
 you want to stay on top of that I give
 some give some background on the project
 and get outlined what kind of feedback
 you're looking for next another thing
 that we'll need to know is well if we go
 over what steps you've taken to get
 there that should give us enough idea
 collectively to tell you what we what we
 know of your project and where it should
 be going so if you're giving feedback
 definitely weigh in on the goals the
 background and what they've done already
 because if you just kind of go off your
 gut feeling like I I like this instead
 so you should try doing this I mean we
 kind of know what we like and that has
 its route and professionalism but what
 we like is subjective and it's not
 objective to what they're trying to
 solve so you want to keep your emotions
 kind of as far from the actual feedback
 that you're giving and then when you're
 giving feedback be nice be very nice so
 these people don't have the same exact
 training as you they haven't read the
 same articles they haven't watched the
 same videos or taking the same courses
 so be nice if you know something that
 they don't kind of help walk them
 through that don't just discount their
 skills and what their effort is you've
 got to give them a little bit of grace
 and then just help them get to that next
 step sometimes I feel like we can get a
 little bent out of shape thank you that
 we could have designed this better or
 why is the client even using this person
 but no you you help these people get
 better that's what they're here to do
 otherwise they wouldn't have asked and
 probably would have put out subpar work
 so we grow stronger through community
 and then lastly if you're giving
 feedback tell them what they did well a
 lot of times should we go straight into
 how do we fix us like what did you do
 wrong how can we fix us well if you
 stray away from if you straight on that
 path about giving them feedback on what
 they did wrong and how to fix it
 definitely correct yourself back on path
 by also complimenting what they did well
 there's nothing worse than having your
 confidence destroyed by somebody who
 thinks that they know better and things
 that you're worthless design pile of
 boot so give them compliments on what
 they did well so actually it could work
 better like a compliment sandwich like
 hey I really like your color choice on
 this it looks like your kerning could be
 a little bit closer between the vertical
 stems of the letters because you got
 them really far apart but the rest of
 your letters seem to be working
 perfectly fine so close that down and
 you should have a better project that's
 just a short example of how that could
 be better now if you're looking for
 places to get good feedback one we run
 the compass of design community this is
 where basically me and a whole bunch of
 other designers get together and we ask
 questions about where we should go in
 our design career
 what we can do to improve our design
 projects that we're working on and then
 we just kind of shoot some fun messages
 back and forth with resources funny
 gifts and any any videos we find
 podcasts which is a lot of fun other
 places that you can look to if you don't
 want to go to compass o design.com slash
 community other places you can look for
 our Facebook groups but you want to look
 for ones that don't have a super whole
 lot of people that's still close and
 intimate or to has a very very good
 reputation so that's like Facebook
 groups slack groups subreddits actually
 I'd stay away from subreddits never had
 any good success there but definitely
 slack groups and Facebook groups are
 some good places to start all right you
 guys I hope that's a little bit helpful
 on how to get and give decent design
 feedback so hopefully I'll keep these
 going weekly I'm sorry for the little
 lapse in videos but I hope you guys have
 a great rest of your day okay thanks
 you
