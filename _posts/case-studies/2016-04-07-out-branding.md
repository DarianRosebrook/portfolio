### Background

#### Building up practice with brand identities

Starting out as a designer is hard, you don't know what to do or learn. Thankfully I found some people to help and they told me to practice with tackling design briefs. I was pointed to a site that held a large database of design briefs for all things design. The one that I decided to tackle was for an outdoor activity center.

Straight from the site
<blockquote>'OUT' is an outdoor activity centre in the Peak District, England. The client would like a new logo and set of icons to use across their brand, for both print and web. 'OUT' appeal to all ages but gets a lot of interest from secondary schools encourage team-building on day trips that . 'OUT' also cater for hen and stag parties, amateur climbers and experienced outdoor sportspeople. Most of their events are run as group excursions, and they market themselves as a fun but challenging day out. The icons will be used on their website, to help users quickly distinguish between the different activities they run. There are 6 main activities: mountaineering, canoeing, rock-climbing, abseiling, caving and team-building. 'OUT' need a simple icon for each exercise. They would also like a similar approach to their main logo, which needs to be professional and to express their love for adventure.</blockquote>

## Goals
* New logo or Brandmark
* Supporting icons / illustrations for the activities
* Icons need to be scalable for easy legibility
* Both need to be expressive of their love for adventure

### Research

#### What did they need for the intended style?

We needed something that fit the idea of growth. When someone is building their knowledge of something, it takes a long time, but that knowledge lasts. So when coming to an idea for the Grow Your Code, I wanted something that fit what the area he's from and the industry his work is in. Both natural yet electronic.

I started thinking of evergreen trees and how they grow over time. Coming up with the first part of the logo is a general feel for the styling.

### Development

I had an initial idea of where to start, so I started to conceptualize what a logo of the sorts, representing code and growth would look like.

![The challenge]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/study/out-branding/sketches.jpg)

What was difficult was coming up with a decent idea within the few days he gave me before his next podcast episode. Once I got a few ideas on paper, I starred what was working. I took from the best elements of each and started to go into illustrator to get the working ideas into a digital form.

### Final Concept

At the end of the skeching both digitally and analog, I came to the conclusion we would need enough sizes for different media, as well as dark and light monochromes should he decide to display on his personal site as well. The finals consist of an emblem with the full name, a circle emblem with the initials, and the hexagonal emblem with the initials. The full logo has the code brackets "\< \>" in there to symbolize the code with the trees as growing. The variant omits the brackets to increase legibility from smaller sizes.

I also threw in a stylized banner radio banner style for flavour.
