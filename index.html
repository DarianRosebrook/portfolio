      <h4>Building the Compass of Design Community app</h4>
      <p class="truncate">This project has been a huge step in what I'm able to achieve as the sole person on a project. This product utilizes my knowledge in UX Design, UI Design, and Back End Development by wrapping all of those together into one product. The Compass of Design Membership Site. This platform is going to be a powerhouse in helping designers get actionable feedback on questions they have and designs they've done. So far, there hasn't been a site that effectively does this without it becoming a popularity contest. Our goal here is to change the way we do design feedback!</p>

      <h5>Brand Identity Designer</h5>
      <h3>So Magnetic</h3>
      <p>Since January of 2017, I've been running my design studio and consultancy full time as a Brand Identity Designer. For older clients and projects, I'm still managing UX design for a few, but our focus for this year is to expand our portfolio to the full branding experience design of a company. This utilizes my history as a UX and UI Designer to map the same principles to branding design and logo design. My role here is to develop strategy and business goals with the client and effectively design a solution that impacts the business and helps them achieve the goals we set. </p>
