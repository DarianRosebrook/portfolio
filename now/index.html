    <h1>Build your Brand into something that Matters</h1>
    <h2>Who is Darian Rosebrook?</h2>
    <p class="desktop">Since the early stages of 2015, I have worked for over 2000 hours building a legacy for my family by working in design. I have been guiding brands with Brand Identity design and Web Design for over a year. As a dedicated single father, I love to share as much time and as many experiences as I humanly can with my son. This same dedication has been put to understanding and pursuing creative solutions to difficult problems. I am always looking for ways to build or improve recognizable brands and user centered websites.  </p>

  <h2>What I've been up to</h2>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Put My Head Down, Got to Work</h4>
    <p>After getting my web certification from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darianrosebrook#background-education" target="_blank">the technical class that I took</a>, I had focused on doing client work and practice briefs. After getting my hands on a couple of college syllabi for design programs, I started consuming content, courses, teaching, and articles around my industry to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archive/case-studies" target="_blank">put those design principles to practice</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
  <h4>I Started Writing</h4>
  <p>Writing has always been a challenge for me. I'm working on pushing past that by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archive/articles" target="_blank">creating articles</a> that are being put out across the internet. Every morning I try to write for at least 20 minutes regarding anything that I need to address, as well as starting my email list for <a href="#mailchimp">a newsletter on growth-hacking, entrepreneurship, and branding.</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Started Working Part-Time</h4>
    <p>You will find that when you are constantly putting out content, asking for feedback, and always trying to grow, that people start to notice. A few months after I had <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archive/grow-your-code-update/" target="_blank">started my first logo design project</a>, the CEO of the new web design agency KeySpark asked if I could come on to the team part time as <a href="https://keyspark.io/#darian" target="_blank">their Design Lead</a> for their projects. I've gotten to work on some crazy projects that I could share <a class="contactBtn" data-href="#contact" href="#contact">upon request</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Revamped My Portfolio</h4>
    <p>One important part of being a designer is having a portfolio that matches the level of professionalism that you are trying to get. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archive/portfolio-v5">My first portfolio</a> was selfishly designed to appease me, without regard to what audience I would be working in and what their needs would be. Though I have gotten inbound leads, this version of the portfolio is only just one of many to come.</p>
