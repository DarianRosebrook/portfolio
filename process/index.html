    <h2>Receiving the Request</h2>
    <p>Hiring a professional to handle a project brings peace of mind. To ensure both the client and the professional are on the same page, there are a few things that the professional needs to understand about the project. To achieve this level of understanding, I include a series of questions for starting the process of getting a quote for the work.</p>
    <p>Serious requests are sent directly to me, and I take the utmost care responding to those inquiries. Because of the volume of requests that I have versus my workload, I carefully consider each project and our ability to work together. I want us to be able to trust in each other's ability to deliver. </p>

    <p>Establishing the goals for the project is the shield against ineffective design. We'll start the project by asking questions that focus on laying out the goals for the organization, how that design project will impact the audience, and what we would like to achieve with the design. Whatever comes from this will drive the end result.</p>
