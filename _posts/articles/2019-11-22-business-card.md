title: Do you need to make a business card as a freelancer?
description: Early on as a designer, I had been hemming and hawing over whether I should spend money on getting myself a business card for my freelancing. I hadn't spent much money getting my business set up and there wasn't enough money flowing that I could spend it on every bell and whistle for my business.

## Yes.
### Yes you do need to make a business card
_Let me tell you a little story over how my card ended up in the City Hall of the town I had lived in back in 2016._

I used to walk the streets of our little town back to visit the small shops and restaurants, taking my son in the stroller with me on my days off. Since I was teaching myself design in the mornings, and most of the days on my days off, this was a relaxing way to avoid overloading myself.

Since it was still early in my design-focused career, I had been learning about color harmony and wanted to start immediately implementing things I learned in everyday scenarios.

### I'm looking at everything as I stroll along:
- The logos of shops
- The colors of the banners hanging off the buildings
- The way awnings clash with the building colors


Suddenly, I nearly ran into a lady that was backing away from a building, clearly more fixated on what was in her hands, holding them up while looking at the mid-height windows of the building.

As I snaked the stroller around her the other direction, I caught a glimpse of what she was holding in her hands.

Paint cards.

Jokingly, I had chimed in,
> "I think the one in your left hand works best."

I was already past her and heading towards the curb corner to cross the street,

After chuckling to myself with the sarcastic quip, I started getting ready to cross the street.

Suddenly, I hear her yelling,
> "wait, wait! Do you really think that one works? I can't seem to wrap my head around this."

I pause, thinking that this might be a good chance to chime in and help someone, I say,
> "Well let me see what other colors you have!"

I head back up to her spot on the sidewalk and take a look at what she has.

The building is a burnt, auburn-red. The awning over the sidewalk is a stark yellow, and she's holding green paint chips and blue paint chips.

From what I've learned about mixing colors, I tell her that she's better of using a blue as it creates a better balance on the color wheel. I give her a small rundown on what I had just learned with color theory.

Suddenly she's asking me about why I know all of these color theory principles. I told her it's because I'm a designer.

Well, that opened the floodgate, as she starts asking all sorts of design-related questions.

She sees that I have my baby with me, and says to me,
> "Listen, I don't want to take all of your time. I would love to follow up with you, is there a way we can get in contact? I work for the city here, and we could definitely use some help in design around here,"

as she's pointing to all the other buildings around.

Thankfully, I've kept a handful of business cards with me wherever I went up there.

Handing her one of my cards as quick as I could, she stashed it away saying,

> "Thanks for the advice here, we could always use help like this."

I wish more work came than the one job I did from that, but had I not have had my card, no one at the City Hall would ever call me asking for more help.

## Because of how early on it was, I almost didn't make any business cards either.

Early on as a designer, I had been hemming and hawing over whether I should spend money on getting myself a business card for my freelancing. I hadn't spent much money getting my business set up and there wasn't enough money flowing that I could spend it on every bell and whistle for my business.

After a week of research, I settled on the fact that I should probably get a business card.

I remember making them through Moo when I had tried to run a retail business, but it felt like if I should make a new card, it should feel like it was truly my own.

I embarked on a small design journey and tried to think of the things that best represented what it was that I did for people.

I decided to create an interesting pattern that represented some fun visual concepts of what I did.
