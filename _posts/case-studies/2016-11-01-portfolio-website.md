### Background

#### A personal touch with a flavor of red and dark purple

It has been exactly a year since I started my journey as a Web Designer and Brand Identity Designer. So it's only fitting that I settle on a final design for my portfolio site. It has been a fun and exhaustive journey, but in the end all of the hard work and sleepless nights have been worth it.

This case study is the second half to the [rebranding of my personal portfolio site. ]({{site.baseurl}}/archive/portfolio-branding) All of the site is personally designed, strategized, and coded by myself, so it really is with pride that I present my own site.

[My Previous Portfolio]({{site.baseurl}}/archive/portfolio-v5) was a self serving site that built up on the previous 3 versions over the last year. Yeah, you read that right. I had four different revisions before this current site.

<small>The technology used that runs the portfolio: Jekyll, Sass, Vanilla Javascript, Github Pages, and Cloudflare</small>

## The Ask
* Mobile Responsive from the beginning
* Optimized for speed
* Change the focus from what I like into what is going to be best for displaying work
* Show how someone could benefit by choosing to work with me
* Unify the brand under a professional style design
* Actually finish designing and developing all pages

### Research

#### Improving the professionalism

I had a love for card design early on in the year 2016. Sadly, it wasn't the best for readability, it performed poorly when scaling up and down my site and wasn't in tune with the rest of the style. A clear change was the removal of the buttons. If everything was a button, there were no buttons. I needed to have clear call to actions, so it came down to two main buttons. A button for hiring me and a button to see more work.

I had reviewed the portfolios of some of the top professionals in my industry and took extensive notes on what was working well for them and some areas where I feel that things could improve.

### Development

My new site is based off of the previous version. I had about 50% of all the assets in place. The order of sections stayed pretty similar with the noticeable changes are the unified brand style and the user experience got a huge facelift. There were many things that I chose to update or build from the ground up again. This allowed me to make sure that I was optimizing sections of code and not repeating some of my first mistakes. You can see below that this is more than just a re-skin of the previous site.

### Final Concept

The final site that follows completes what I had originally envisioned when creating a personal portfolio for displaying work. It lays out many of my work and case studies together in an easy to digest manner. The css is built so that the default styles are for the smallest sizes first and reorder the elements on the page as the device size scales up. Much of what I see is the opposite where they cut elements from the page instead. I have finished my site and plan on continualy working hard to improve where I can.
