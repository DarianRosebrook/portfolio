### Background

#### KeySpark, a web design firm from Ontario Canada

Keyspark has been a great company to work for. Redesigning their site was the first thing I was tasked to do as a new addition to their team. Based off of spec work, they wanted to have a site that comes from a part of the team.

We worked together building a site aesthetic first and went from there.

<small>Tools used: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Sketching</small>

## Goals
* Refresh the current branding of KS
* Utilize the new pictures and brand assets
* Create pages for Home, About, Blog, Products, and contact
* Everything needs to be mobile friendly

### Research

The site had been designed once before and it took a different approach to the company's direction. This was towards the beginning of KeySpark and their decision to market themselves to game developers. Their original idea wasn't very mobile friendly so I decided to start the design from the bottom size to the largest.

#### Where to start?

I updated the graphics and [styles of the brand]() to bring the logo and website under one design system.

The original didn't have a clear direction or unified look to it.

So taking the logo work and brand style guide, I took to creating a visual style of the website that could be seen as more unified but also focused on interest.

### Development

There were a few pages that needed to be added to the project. When talking with Tyrel, we needed to focus on the first few (Home, About, Contact)

I moved on to create some working prototypes of the site design.

At the end of the branding part of the project I went back and laid out all of the icons again to be sure I could say they sit within the correct visual style. We moved into putting the pieces together on the page.

### Final Concept

Once the final brand assets were in place we went to production with the styles.
