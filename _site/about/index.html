    <h1>Build your Brand into something that Matters</h1>
    <h2>Who is Darian Rosebrook?</h2>
    <p class="desktop">Since the early stages of 2015, I have worked for over 2000 hours building a legacy for my family by working in design. I have been guiding brands with Brand Identity design and Web Design for over a year. As a dedicated single father, I love to share as much time and as many experiences as I humanly can with my son. This same dedication has been put to understanding and pursuing creative solutions to difficult problems. I am always looking for ways to build or improve recognizable brands and user centered websites.  </p>

        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <blockquote class="mobile">&ldquo;Since the early stages of 2015, Darian Rosebrook has worked for over 2000 hours building a legacy for his family with design. His creative eye has been guiding brands with Brand Identity design and Web Design for over a year. As a dedicated single father, his understanding of how to seek out knowledge and come up with creative solutions drove his passion for parenting as well as design. Darian is always looking for ways to improve and build recognizable brands and user centered websites.&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>Though I have done simple versions of design of work before, I started taking design seriously in August 2015. There were plenty occupations that I had experience doing, and a large portion did not directly relate to doing websites or branding for businesses. My only solution to my lack of history was to get education and practice.</p>
        <p>I started by asking around where people had been learning how to do what they do. Though I kept hearing that I just "need to start", my initial plan was to get some of the ball rolling as soon as possible. To do this, I enrolled into a 3 month long certification course.</p>
        <p>After starting this hustle, I eventually acquired a handful of mentors, people who could keep me on task and motivated. For me to be able to get done what I needed to do during the day, I needed more time. After a while, I had to forgo some things to be able to keep my learning and projects going, sacrificing one of the more important human needs.

      <p>Back towards the beginning of my carreer as a web designer, I had the opportunity to be interviewed on air for the Grow Your Code podcast. The podcast logo was an early project of mine, and I have since been iterating and continually practicing. But for those who might have missed it when I started, <a href="http://www.growyourcode.com/episodes/28402-a-chat-with-darian-rosebrook" target="_blank">here is the podcast that I was interviewed on</a></p>
      <p>Here are a few questions we covered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What do you do?</li>
        <li>How did you get into UI/UX design?</li>
        <li>What do you love/like about your field? Anything you dislike or find hard to do?</li>
        <li>If you could be better at one aspect of your field what would it be?</li>
        <li>What does your future look like and how do you plan to get there?</li>

  <h2>What I've been up to</h2>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Put My Head Down, Got to Work</h4>
    <p>After getting my web certification from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darianrosebrook#background-education" target="_blank">the technical class that I took</a>, I had focused on doing client work and practice briefs. After getting my hands on a couple of college syllabi for design programs, I started consuming content, courses, teaching, and articles around my industry to <a href="/archive/case-studies" target="_blank">put those design principles to practice</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>I Started Writing</h4>
    <p>Writing has always been a challenge for me. I'm working on pushing past that by <a href="/archive/articles" target="_blank">creating articles</a> that are being put out across the internet. Every morning I try to write for at least 20 minutes regarding anything that I need to address, as well as starting my email list for <a href="#mailchimp">a newsletter on growth-hacking, entrepreneurship, and branding.</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Started Working Part-Time</h4>
    <p>You will find that when you are constantly putting out content, asking for feedback, and always trying to grow, that people start to notice. A few months after I had <a href="/archive/grow-your-code-update/" target="_blank">started my first logo design project</a>, the CEO of the new web design agency KeySpark asked if I could come on to the team part time as <a href="https://keyspark.io/#darian" target="_blank">their Design Lead</a> for their projects. I've gotten to work on some crazy projects that I could share <a class="contactBtn" data-href="#contact" href="#contact">upon request</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Revamped My Portfolio</h4>
    <p>One important part of being a designer is having a portfolio that matches the level of professionalism that you are trying to get. <a href="/archive/portfolio-v5">My first portfolio</a> was selfishly designed to appease me, without regard to what audience I would be working in and what their needs would be. Though I have gotten inbound leads, this version of the portfolio is only just one of many to come.</p>
