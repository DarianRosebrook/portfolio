### Introduction
#### A portfolio website to showcase my featured articles and case studies
It has been exactly a year since I started my journey as a Web Designer and Brand Identity Designer. So it's only fitting that I settle on a final brand style for my personal brand. I have iterated and iterated until I had a style that I wanted. When I recently reviewed my personal brand in terms of professionalism, I figured since my skillset has increased that it was time to revisit and rebrand.

This case study is the first half to the [rebranding of my personal portfolio site. ]({{site.baseurl}}/archive/portfolio-website) All of the site is personally designed, strategized, and coded by myself, so it really is with pride that I present my own brand.

<small>Tools used: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Sketching</small>

## Goals
* New logo or Brandmark
* Clean up my icons shape and lines
* Unify the brand style and consistency
* Create a design system for the project

### Research

#### Improving the professionalism in my personal brand

After much review of other professional's portfolios and some of the largest agencies' portfolios, I had come to the conclusion that my personal brand was lacking the spark that really spoke towards my own goals. A professional's portfolio should speak to their own quality of work, so if you looked at my previous one, I apologize and hope that's not why you chose to avoid me. (It's okay, I forgive you)

### Development

I have audited myself and found that most of my previous assets have been misaligned with the brand and level of professionalism that I wanted to portray. I went into the previous icons and visited the old style to come up with something that actually fit my skillset and style. The new icons seemed to fit the brand better. I also started the Sass variables in code to keep from manually messing up the overall website too.

I moved on to create some working prototypes of the site design.

### Final Concept

At the end of the branding part of the project I went back and laid out all of the icons again to be sure I could say they sit within the correct visual style. I wanted both a higher level of professional quality and the ability to call something my own design.
Each uses the same colors as outlined above in the color palette.
