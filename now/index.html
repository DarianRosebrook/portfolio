    <h2>What am I up to nowadays?</h2>
    <div class="module">
      <p>What started as a side hustle, became a full time passion in 2015. I had been freelancing as a web designer to stay connected to a creative industry when I decided to focus on design as a full time pursuit. In mid 2016, I had joined a small team of developers as their lead designer based on my experience with UX Design and UI Design. When the work started to slow down with that team, in January 2017, I decided to focus full time on client work again. This time, by handling larger design clients and projects, where I could also hire and manage other designers to work in tandem to complete these projects.</p>

    <div class="module">
      <p>My two areas of expertise run along side each other. As a designer, I am adept at handling both the user experience of digital products and the brand experience of a product's design ecosystem (product, packaging, logo design, etc.) Both of these thrive from the same research, and both have the same path of exploration. As a designer, I couldn't find a better way to marry the skills I learned as a UX designer and my passion for creating meaningful brand experiences both on and off screens.</p>

      <h4>Building the Compass of Design Community app</h4>
      <p >This project has been a huge step in what I'm able to achieve as the sole person on a project. This product utilizes my knowledge in UX Design, UI Design, and Back End Development by wrapping all of those together into one product. The Compass of Design Membership Site. This platform is going to be a powerhouse in helping designers get actionable feedback on questions they have and designs they've done. So far, there hasn't been a site that effectively does this without it becoming a popularity contest. Our goal here is to change the way we do design feedback!</p>
